National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (NDIS Act) states that a funded support must represent \u201cvalue for money\u201d in that the costs of the support are reasonable, relative to both the benefits achieved and the cost of alternative support.  Determining whether a support is reasonable and necessary for an individual participant will be guided by the NDIS Act (2013), the associated NDIS Rules, and the National Disability Insurance Agency\u2019s (NDIA) Operational Guidelines. These can be found on the NDIA website. This Guide is not a comprehensive list of all Assistive Technology (AT) supports that may be provided as reasonable and necessary under the NDIS, but lists the most commonly used supports to assist providers to claim payments using a \u201cbest-fit\u201d approach, and to assist participants with consistent terminology for AT comparison.

A comprehensive listing of AT support line items is kept up to date in a separate file (csv format) on the NDIS website. All providers from each state and territory can now register with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. Support Purpose NDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes: 1.  CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant budgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support budgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or capacity building supports). 2.  CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle modifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this support purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant\u2019s plan.

CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and skills.  Support Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework Participant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the goals set out in the participant\u2019s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes Framework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and overall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which help participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners explore where supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These domains are: 1. Daily Living 5. Work 2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation 3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships 4. Lifelong Learning 8.

Support purpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support categories, with additional categories in the new PACE system. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and providers to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant\u2019s goals.

As a starting point, providers should claim against the relevant support line item which has been specified in the participant\u2019s plan, or as stated in the Service Booking with the participant. Only where there is no specific line item identified, providers should claim payments against the support line item that most closely aligns to the product or service they have delivered. Payment requests should accurately reflect the Unit of Measure (UOM) indicated against the Support Item. Thus outright purchase will usually be for a single item (1 x $invoice each), while three hours of communication device programming would be 3 units against an hourly UOM (3 x $charge/hr).
